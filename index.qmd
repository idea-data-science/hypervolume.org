title: Hypervolume
---

This page presents a collection of links and papers related to the hypervolume quality indicator, a measure often used to assess the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.
It is also used directly inside meta-heuristics, e.g. EAs, to provide a selection pressure rewarding convergence as well as objective-space diversity of the candidate solutions.
Hypervolume has the drawback that it takes exponential time in the number of dimensions to compute.
For this reason, there is an active community developing faster algorithms (in theory and in practice) for this important problem.

Things you'll find on this page:

* [Problem descriptions](problem-descriptions.qmd) of the different problems related to hypervolume.
* A list of known [implementations](software.qmd) of the different algorithms.
* A list of [papers](bibliography.qmd) published.

Finally [here](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/rudolph/hypervolume/start) is a link to the "old" page as part of Guenter Rudolph's home page at the LS11, TU Dortmund.
